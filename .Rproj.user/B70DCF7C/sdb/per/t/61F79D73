Even when you fit your first model, you can't say that you master all the subtleties of the exercise.\n\nTo understand it, it needed me [that book](https://www.amazon.fr/S%C3%A9ries-temporelles-avec-M%C3%A9thodes-cas/dp/2817802071/277-5178286-1463028?ie=UTF8&tag=duckduckgo-ffnt-fr-21) that only french reader can understand and [that shiny app](http://alstatr.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/r-explore-arima2-2-2-subclass-family-on.html) to finally be comfortable  to implement ARIMA model in a professional environment. That [web site](http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411arim2.htm), also, is a great resource. \n\nThe ARIMA picker is an add-in made to help to speed the learning curve, mainly by making the simulation and analysis steps faster.\n\nThe app is a simplification of the app of @allstatr, to make it fast to run and light to load.\n\nTo launch the app as an add-in, you need a recent version of Rstudio(v0.99.878 or later).\nOtherwise, you still could enjoy the `arimaUI` function.\n\nTo install the add-in:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"YvesCR/arimaUI\")\nlibrary(arimaUI)\n```\n\nTo use the app, select the timeseries you want to display in your code, then click Addins >> arima_addin.\n\nThe best way to familiarize yourself with the function is to play with it.\nFor exemple by simulating in a blind way the components of your time serie:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n# simulation of the components (p, d, q). \norder.blind <- floor(runif(3, 0, 3))\n\n# For ARIMA models with differencing, the differenced series follows a zero-mean ARMA model\nif(order.blind[2] > 0) order.blind[1] <- 0\n\n# simulation of the parameters\nar.blind <- runif(order.blind[1], -1, 1)\nma.blind <- runif(order.blind[3], -1, 1)\n\n# below 50 points, finding the correct components is challenging.\nsim.ts <- arima.sim(\nn = 100,\nmodel = list(\n  order = order.blind,\n  ar = ar.blind\n, ma = ma.blind\n))\n\nlist.res <- arimaUI(sim.ts)\n```\n\nIf the numbers of the components that you pick in the end is equal to the ones which had been randomly selected, you are truly skilled, congratulations.\n\nTo note, when the coefficients are near 0, there is simply no way to guess them. It is indeed a tricky game. \n\n",
