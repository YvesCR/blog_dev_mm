This is the repo github of my web site.

The repository is published here: www.data-laborer.eu.

This is a jekyll website. The process I use to update it:

  * First, write a post in R with rmarkdown.
  * Then compile and test locally the post, using `servr::jekyll()`.
  * Push the site to github.
  * And Voila.
 
 The local folder building the website could be found [here](https://github.com/YvesCR/blog_dev_mm).
 
 (For obvious reason, it the same README file in both cases)
