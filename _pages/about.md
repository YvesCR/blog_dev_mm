Data scientist, interested in stats, data visualisation and hacks. My main tools are R and python, with a try at SAS.
I have a master degree from the French scientific university of Burgundy.
	
I really like London, as people in this city are full of energy and ideas. I spend a lot of time in the meetup groups of London, learning concepts and looking for new ideas of articles.

Why blogging?

 * For self promotion
 * To devellop ideas
 * To have a reminder for my code
 * Give back to the open source and academic communities
