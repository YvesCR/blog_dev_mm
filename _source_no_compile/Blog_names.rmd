---


If you think data-laborer is an awfull name for a blog on data science, wait to see the list of names you were spared of:

heavy-data: A blog to handle the next generation of big data.

sumo-data: A blog to handle heavy data.

data-civilisation: oops, it was my first web site.

the-missing-link-of-data: one link short.

data-man: A new generation of super heroes, doing good and justice from his couch.

beauty-and-the-data: A blog on data visualisation (and disney).
